      <p class="content-title-p">Entering a Calculus class can be tough if your Algebra and Trigonometry skills aren't up to par. It's not about blaming past teachers, but realizing that not all Algebra or Trigonometry classes get you ready for the challenges of Calculus. Sometimes these courses are more general and miss the specifics needed.</p>
      <p>The intent of this chapter, therefore, is to do a very cursory review of some algebra and trig skills that are vital to a calculus course that many students just didn't learn as well as they should have from their Algebra and Trig courses.</p>
      <p>This chapter does not include all the algebra and trig skills that are needed to be successful in a Calculus course. It only includes those topics that most students are particularly deficient in. For instance, factoring is also vital to completing a standard calculus class but is not included here as it is assumed that if you are taking a Calculus course then you do know how to factor. Likewise, it is assumed that if you are taking a Calculus course then you know how to solve linear and quadratic equations so those topics are not covered here either.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Functions</h2>
        <p>Functions are the backbone of mathematics, providing a framework to understand how quantities change and relate to each other. In this section, we'll explore the power of Functions, which are like mathematical tools that describe how one thing depends on another. We'll learn about function notation, which is a fancy way of writing functions, and how to evaluate functions for different inputs. Understanding functions also involves finding their domain and range, which tells us where the function is defined and what values it can take. Additionally, we'll delve into function composition, a method of combining functions to create new ones with unique properties. So get ready to uncover the dynamic nature of Functions and how they serve as the fundamental building blocks of Calculus.</p>
